/**
 Creates the default navigation route.
 Sends request to navigation system to calculate and render a path between two locations. If both source and destination locations are
 inside the venue, or if the mode is **non-overlay*, then only indoor navigation service is used. Otherwise, outdoor navigation
 service is used together with indoor navigation service to calculate the full path.
 
 A location is considered inside the venue if it's coordinate is inside the venue polygon (the polygon is defined in **Venue.geojson**).
 `PC_IndoorMapManagerDelegate` can override it in `-[PC_IndoorMapManagerDelegate indoorMapManager:isPointInsideVenue:isDestination:hint:]` method.
